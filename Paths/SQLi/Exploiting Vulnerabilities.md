Error-Based
	Submit `'` or `"` 
	Different characters give different errors

UNION-based
	There is two basic rules:
	The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries
	The data type must be compatible
	Exploitation:
		Figure out the number of columns that the query is making:
			order by clause: order by 1--
				Increment the number of columns until you get a error
			Null values:
				' UNION SELECT NULL--
					Increment until you no longer get a error
		Figure the data type of the columns (mainly for string data):
			Probe each column to see in the can hold string data by submitting a series of UNION SELECT payloads that place a string value into each column:
				' UNION SELECT 'a' ,NULL--
				' UNION SELECT NULL ,'a'--
		Use UNION operator to output the information from the database

Boolean-based Blind SQL:
	Submit a Boolean condition that evaluates to False and note the response
	Submit a Bollean condition that evaluates to True
	Write a program that uses conditional statements to ask the database

Time-Based
	Submit a payloads that pauses the application for a specified period of time
	Write a program that uses conditional statements and monitor the reponse time

Out-of-band
	Submit OAST payloads designed to trigger and out-of-band network interection when executed within an SQL query and monitor the results (DNS look up)
	Depending the database use different methods to exfil data
