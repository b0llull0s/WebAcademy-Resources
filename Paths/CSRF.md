- Cross-site request forgery is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce users to perform actions that they do not intend to perform.

- Allows an attacker to partly circumvent the same origin policy, which is designed to prevent different websites from interfering with each other.

## What is the impact of a CSRF attack?

- In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker causes the victim user to carry out an action unintentionally.

- For example, this might be to change the email address on their account, to change their password, or to make a funds transfer. 

- Depending on the nature of the action, the attacker might be able to gain full control over the user's account.

- If the compromised user has a privileged role within the application, then the attacker might be able to take full control of all the application's data and functionality.

## How does CSRF work?

- For a CSRF attack to be possible, three key conditions must be in place:

	- **A relevant action.** There is an action within the application that the attacker has a reason to induce. This might be a privileged action (such as modifying permissions for other users) or any action on user-specific data (such as changing the user's own password).

	- **Cookie-based session handling.** Performing the action involves issuing one or more HTTP requests, and the application relies solely on session cookies to identify the user who has made the requests. There is no other mechanism in place for tracking sessions or validating user requests.

	- **No unpredictable request parameters.** The requests that perform the action do not contain any parameters whose values the attacker cannot determine or guess. For example, when causing a user to change their password, the function is not vulnerable if an attacker needs to know the value of the existing password.

### Payload Example

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change" method="POST">
			<input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" />
		</form>
		<script> document.forms[0].submit();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```

## How to construct a CSRF attack

- The easiest way to construct a CSRF exploit is using the `CSRF PoC generator` that is built in to `Burp Suite Professional`:

	- Select a request anywhere in Burp Suite Professional that you want to test or exploit.

	- From the right-click context menu, select Engagement tools / Generate CSRF PoC.

	- Burp Suite will generate some HTML that will trigger the selected request (minus cookies, which will be added automatically by the victim's browser).

	- You can tweak various options in the CSRF PoC generator to fine-tune aspects of the attack. You might need to do this in some unusual situations to deal with quirky features of requests.

	- Copy the generated HTML into a web page, view it in a browser that is logged in to the vulnerable website, and test whether the intended request is issued successfully and the desired action occurs.

## How to deliver a CSRF exploit

- The delivery mechanisms for cross-site request forgery attacks are essentially the same as for reflected XSS.

- Typically, the attacker will place the malicious HTML onto a website that they control, and then induce victims to visit that website.

- This might be done by feeding the user a link to the website, via an email or social media message. Or if the attack is placed into a popular website (for example, in a user comment), they might just wait for users to visit the website.

- Note that some simple CSRF exploits employ the GET method and can be fully self-contained with a single URL on the vulnerable website. In this situation, the attacker may not need to employ an external site, and can directly feed victims a malicious URL on the vulnerable domain. 

- In the preceding example, if the request to change email address can be performed with the GET method, then a self-contained attack would look like this:
```
<img src="https://vulnerable-website.com/email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net">
```

## Common defences against CSRF

- The most common defenses you'll encounter are as follows

### **CSRF tokens**

- A CSRF token is a unique, secret, and unpredictable value that is generated by the server-side application and shared with the client. When attempting to perform a sensitive action, such as submitting a form, the client must include the correct CSRF token in the request. This makes it very difficult for an attacker to construct a valid request on behalf of the victim.

- A common way to share CSRF tokens with the client is to include them as a hidden parameter in an HTML form, for example:
	
```html
<form name="change-email-form" action="/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
	<label>Email</label>
	<input required type="email" name="email" value="example@normal-website.com">
	<input required type="hidden" name="csrf" value="50FaWgdOhi9M9wyna8taR1k3ODOR8d6u">
	<button class='button' type='submit'> Update email </button>
</form>
```

- CSRF tokens don't have to be sent as hidden parameters in a `POST` request. Some applications place CSRF tokens in HTTP headers, for example. The way in which tokens are transmitted has a significant impact on the security of a mechanism as a whole.
### **SameSite cookies**

- SameSite is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites. As requests to perform sensitive actions typically require an authenticated session cookie, the appropriate SameSite restrictions may prevent an attacker from triggering these actions cross-site. Since 2021, Chrome enforces `Lax` SameSite restrictions by default. As this is the proposed standard, we expect other major browsers to adopt this behavior in future.

### **Referer-based validation**

- Some applications make use of the HTTP Referer header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain. This is generally less effective than CSRF token validation.

## Common flaws in CSRF token validation
### Validation of CSRF token depends on request method

- Some applications correctly validate the token when the request uses the POST method but skip the validation when the GET method is used.

- In this situation, the attacker can switch to the GET method to bypass the validation and deliver a CSRF attack:

```
GET /email/change?email=pwned@evil-user.net HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Cookie: session=2yQIDcpia41WrATfjPqvm9tOkDvkMvLm
```

### Validation of CSRF token depends on token being present

- Some applications correctly validate the token when it is present but skip the validation if the token is omitted.

- In this situation, the attacker can remove the entire parameter containing the token (not just its value) to bypass the validation and deliver a CSRF attack:

```
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 25
Cookie: session=2yQIDcpia41WrATfjPqvm9tOkDvkMvLm

email=pwned@evil-user.net
```

### CSRF token is not tied to the user session

- Some applications do not validate that the token belongs to the same session as the user who is making the request. Instead, the application maintains a global pool of tokens that it has issued and accepts any token that appears in this pool.

- In this situation, the attacker can log in to the application using their own account, obtain a valid token, and then feed that token to the victim user in their CSRF attack.

###  CSRF token is tied to a non-session cookie

In a variation on the preceding vulnerability, some applications do tie the CSRF token to a cookie, but not to the same cookie that is used to track sessions. This can easily occur when an application employs two different frameworks, one for session handling and one for CSRF protection, which are not integrated together:

```
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 68
Cookie: session=pSJYSScWKpmC60LpFOAHKixuFuM4uXWF; csrfKey=rZHCnSzEp8dbI6atzagGoSYyqJqTz5dv 

csrf=RhV7yQDO0xcq9gLEah2WVbmuFqyOq7tY&email=wiener@normal-user.com
```

- This situation is harder to exploit but is still vulnerable. If the website contains any behavior that allows an attacker to set a cookie in a victim's browser, then an attack is possible.

- The attacker can log in to the application using their own account, obtain a valid token and associated cookie, leverage the cookie-setting behavior to place their cookie into the victim's browser, and feed their token to the victim in their CSRF attack.

- The cookie-setting behavior does not even need to exist within the same web application as the CSRF vulnerability. Any other application within the same overall DNS domain can potentially be leveraged to set cookies in the application that is being targeted, if the cookie that is controlled has suitable scope. For example, a cookie-setting function on `staging.demo.normal-website.com` could be leveraged to place a cookie that is submitted to `secure.normal-website.com`.

## CSRF token is simply duplicated in a cookie

- In a further variation on the preceding vulnerability, some applications do not maintain any server-side record of tokens that have been issued, but instead duplicate each token within a cookie and a request parameter.

- When the subsequent request is validated, the application simply verifies that the token submitted in the request parameter matches the value submitted in the cookie.

- This is sometimes called the "double submit" defense against CSRF, and is advocated because it is simple to implement and avoids the need for any server-side state:

```
POST /email/change HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-website.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 68
Cookie: session=1DQGdzYbOJQzLP7460tfyiv3do7MjyPw; csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa 

csrf=R8ov2YBfTYmzFyjit8o2hKBuoIjXXVpa&email=wiener@normal-user.com
```

- The attacker can again perform a CSRF attack if the website contains any cookie setting functionality. Here, the attacker doesn't need to obtain a valid token of their own. They simply invent a token (perhaps in the required format, if that is being checked), leverage the cookie-setting behavior to place their cookie into the victim's browser, and feed their token to the victim in their CSRF attack.

## Bypassing `SameSite` cookie restrictions

- `SameSite` is a browser security mechanism that determines when a website's cookies are included in requests originating from other websites.

- Since 2021, Chrome applies `Lax` SameSite restrictions by default if the website that issues the cookie doesn't explicitly set its own restriction level.

- This is a proposed standard, and we expect other major browsers to adopt this behavior in the future.

## What is a site in the context of SameSite cookies?

- In the context of SameSite cookie restrictions, a site is defined as the top-level domain (TLD), usually something like `.com` or `.net`, plus one additional level of the domain name. This is often referred to as the TLD+1.

- When determining whether a request is same-site or not, the URL scheme is also taken into consideration. This means that a link from `http://app.example.com` to `https://app.example.com` is treated as cross-site by most browsers.

- You may come across the term "effective top-level domain" (eTLD). This is just a way of accounting for the reserved multipart suffixes that are treated as top-level domains in practice, such as `.co.uk`.

## What's the difference between a site and an origin?

- The difference between a site and an origin is their scope; a site encompasses multiple domain names, whereas an origin only includes one. Although they're closely related, it's important not to use the terms interchangeably as conflating the two can have serious security implications.

- Two URLs are considered to have the same origin if they share the exact same scheme, domain name, and port. Although note that the port is often inferred from the scheme.

|                           |                                |                       |                            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | --------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Request from**          | **Request to**                 | **Same-site?**        | **Same-origin?**           |
| `https://example.com`     | `https://example.com`          | Yes                   | Yes                        |
| `https://app.example.com` | `https://intranet.example.com` | Yes                   | No: mismatched domain name |
| `https://example.com`     | `https://example.com:8080`     | Yes                   | No: mismatched port        |
| `https://example.com`     | `https://example.co.uk`        | No: mismatched eTLD   | No: mismatched domain name |
| `https://example.com`     | `http://example.com`           | No: mismatched scheme | No: mismatched scheme      |

- This is an important distinction as it means that any vulnerability enabling arbitrary JavaScript execution can be abused to bypass site-based defenses on other domains belonging to the same site.

## How does `SameSite` work?

- Before the `SameSite` mechanism was introduced, browsers sent cookies in every request to the domain that issued them, even if the request was triggered by an unrelated third-party website.

- `SameSite` works by enabling browsers and website owners to limit which cross-site requests, if any, should include specific cookies.

- All major browsers currently support the following `SameSite` restriction levels:

	- `Strict`
	- `Lax`
	- `None`

- Developers can manually configure a restriction level for each cookie they set, giving them more control over when these cookies are used.

- To do this, they just have to include the `SameSite` attribute in the `Set-Cookie` response header, along with their preferred value:

`Set-Cookie: session=0F8tgdOhi9ynR1M9wa3ODa; SameSite=Strict`

- If the website issuing the cookie doesn't explicitly set a `SameSite` attribute, Chrome automatically applies `Lax` restrictions by default.
- This means that the cookie is only sent in cross-site requests that meet specific criteria, even though the developers never configured this behavior. As this is a proposed new standard, we expect other major browsers to adopt this behavior in future.

## Strict

- If a cookie is set with the `SameSite=Strict` attribute, browsers will not send it in any cross-site requests. 

- This is recommended when setting cookies that enable the bearer to modify data or perform other sensitive actions, such as accessing specific pages that are only available to authenticated users.

## Lax

- `Lax` `SameSite` restrictions mean that browsers will send the cookie in cross-site requests, but only if both of the following conditions are met:

	- The request uses the `GET` method.
    
	- The request resulted from a top-level navigation by the user, such as clicking on a link.
    
- This means that the cookie is not included in cross-site `POST` requests. 

- As `POST` requests are generally used to perform actions that modify data or state

- Likewise, the cookie is not included in background requests, such as those initiated by scripts, iframes, or references to images and other resources.

## None

- If a cookie is set with the `SameSite=None` attribute, this effectively disables `SameSite` restrictions altogether, regardless of the browser. As a result, browsers will send this cookie in all requests to the site that issued it, even those that were triggered by completely unrelated third-party sites.

- With the exception of Chrome, this is the default behavior used by major browsers if no `SameSite` attribute is provided when setting the cookie.

- There are legitimate reasons for disabling `SameSite`, such as when the cookie is intended to be used from a third-party context and doesn't grant the bearer access to any sensitive data or functionality. Tracking cookies are a typical example.

- If you encounter a cookie set with `SameSite=None` or with no explicit restrictions, it's worth investigating whether it's of any use. 

- When the "Lax-by-default" behavior was first adopted by Chrome, this had the side-effect of breaking a lot of existing web functionality.

- As a quick workaround, some websites have opted to simply disable `SameSite` restrictions on all cookies, including potentially sensitive ones.

- When setting a cookie with `SameSite=None`, the website must also include the `Secure` attribute, which ensures that the cookie is only sent in encrypted messages over HTTPS. Otherwise, browsers will reject the cookie and it won't be set.

`Set-Cookie: trackingId=0F8tgdOhi9ynR1M9wa3ODa; SameSite=None; Secure`

## Bypassing SameSite Lax restrictions using GET requests

- In practice, servers aren't always fussy about whether they receive a `GET` or `POST` request to a given endpoint, even those that are expecting a form submission. If they also use `Lax` restrictions for their session cookies, either explicitly or due to the browser default, you may still be able to perform a CSRF attack by eliciting a `GET` request from the victim's browser.

- As long as the request involves a top-level navigation, the browser will still include the victim's session cookie. The following is one of the simplest approaches to launching such an attack:

`<script> document.location = 'https://vulnerable-website.com/account/transfer-payment?recipient=hacker&amount=1000000'; </script>`

- Even if an ordinary `GET` request isn't allowed, some frameworks provide ways of overriding the method specified in the request line.

- For example, Symfony supports the `_method` parameter in forms, which takes precedence over the normal method for routing purposes:

```
<form action="https://vulnerable-website.com/account/transfer-payment" method="POST">
	<input type="hidden" name="_method" value="GET">
	<input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="hacker">
	<input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000000">
</form>
```

- Other frameworks support a variety of similar parameters.

## Bypassing **`SameSite`** restrictions using on-site gadgets

- If a cookie is set with the `SameSite=Strict` attribute, browsers won't include it in any cross-site requests.

- You may be able to get around this limitation if you can find a gadget that results in a secondary request within the same site.

- One possible gadget is a client-side redirect that dynamically constructs the redirection target using attacker-controllable input like URL parameters.

- As far as browsers are concerned, these client-side redirects aren't really redirects at all; the resulting request is just treated as an ordinary, standalone request. Most importantly, this is a same-site request and, as such, will include all cookies related to the site, regardless of any restrictions that are in place.

- If you can manipulate this gadget to elicit a malicious secondary request, this can enable you to bypass any `SameSite` cookie restrictions completely.

- Note that the equivalent attack is not possible with server-side redirects. In this case, browsers recognize that the request to follow the redirect resulted from a cross-site request initially, so they still apply the appropriate cookie restrictions.

## Bypassing SameSite restrictions via vulnerable sibling domains

- it's essential to keep in mind that a request can still be same-site even if it's issued cross-origin.

- Make sure you thoroughly audit all of the available attack surface, including any sibling domains.

- In particular, vulnerabilities that enable you to elicit an arbitrary secondary request, such as XSS, can compromise site-based defenses completely, exposing all of the site's domains to cross-site attacks.

- In addition to classic CSRF, don't forget that if the target website supports WebSockets, this functionality might be vulnerable to cross-site WebSocket hijacking (CSWSH), which is essentially just a CSRF attack targeting a WebSocket handshake.

## Bypassing SameSite Lax restrictions with newly issued cookies

- Cookies with `Lax` SameSite restrictions aren't normally sent in any cross-site `POST` requests, but there are some exceptions.

- To avoid breaking single sign-on (SSO) mechanisms, it doesn't actually enforce these restrictions for the first 120 seconds on top-level `POST` requests. As a result, there is a two-minute window in which users may be susceptible to cross-site attacks.

- This two-minute window does not apply to cookies that were explicitly set with the `SameSite=Lax` attribute.

- On the other hand, if you can find a gadget on the site that enables you to force the victim to be issued a new session cookie, you can preemptively refresh their cookie before following up with the main attack.

- For example, completing an OAuth-based login flow may result in a new session each time as the OAuth service doesn't necessarily know whether the user is still logged in to the target site.

- To trigger the cookie refresh without the victim having to manually log in again, you need to use a top-level navigation, which ensures that the cookies associated with their current OAuth session are included. This poses an additional challenge because you then need to redirect the user back to your site so that you can launch the CSRF attack.

Alternatively, you can trigger the cookie refresh from a new tab so the browser doesn't leave the page before you're able to deliver the final attack. A minor snag with this approach is that browsers block popup tabs unless they're opened via a manual interaction. For example, the following popup will be blocked by the browser by default:

`window.open('https://vulnerable-website.com/login/sso');`

To get around this, you can wrap the statement in an `onclick` event handler as follows:

`window.onclick = () => { window.open('https://vulnerable-website.com/login/sso'); }`

This way, the `window.open()` method is only invoked when the user clicks somewhere on the page.

## Bypassing Referer-based CSRF defenses

- Aside from defenses that employ CSRF tokens, some applications make use of the HTTP `Referer` header to attempt to defend against CSRF attacks, normally by verifying that the request originated from the application's own domain.

- This approach is generally less effective and is often subject to bypasses.

#### Referer header

- The HTTP Referer header (which is inadvertently misspelled in the HTTP specification) is an optional request header that contains the URL of the web page that linked to the resource that is being requested.

- It is generally added automatically by browsers when a user triggers an HTTP request, including by clicking a link or submitting a form.

- Various methods exist that allow the linking page to withhold or modify the value of the `Referer` header. This is often done for privacy reasons.

## Validation of Referer depends on header being present

- Some applications validate the `Referer` header when it is present in requests but skip the validation if the header is omitted.

- In this situation, an attacker can craft their CSRF exploit in a way that causes the victim user's browser to drop the `Referer` header in the resulting request. 

- There are various ways to achieve this, but the easiest is using a META tag within the HTML page that hosts the CSRF attack:

```html
<meta name="referrer" content="never">
```

## Validation of Referer can be circumvented

- Some applications validate the `Referer` header in a naive way that can be bypassed. 

- if the application validates that the domain in the `Referer` starts with the expected value, then the attacker can place this as a subdomain of their own domain:

```
http://vulnerable-website.com.attacker-website.com/csrf-attack
```

- Likewise, if the application simply validates that the `Referer` contains its own domain name, then the attacker can place the required value elsewhere in the URL:

```
http://attacker-website.com/csrf-attack?vulnerable-website.com
```

- Although you may be able to identify this behavior using Burp, you will often find that this approach no longer works when you go to test your proof-of-concept in a browser. 

- In an attempt to reduce the risk of sensitive data being leaked in this way, many browsers now strip the query string from the `Referer` header by default.

- You can override this behavior by making sure that the response containing your exploit has the `Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url` header set (note that `Referrer` is spelled correctly in this case, just to make sure you're paying attention!). This ensures that the full URL will be sent, including the query string.
